## Background & History

* **Summary:** Balken Ribb, a resilient Frogkin, immigrated to Vallencia as a tadpole with his family. Facing early hardship and persecution, he learned the inn trade from his parents, who worked in a Lower Ring establishment. His father, a skilled cook, taught him the recipe for a famed Juju fruit pie. After his parents fell ill, Balken took a significant loan to establish "The Not So Shabby Cat Inn" in the Middle Ring. He distinguished his inn with its popular Juju fruit pie and, crucially, by introducing affordable nightly entertainment, making it a beloved spot for the city's middle class. He has since achieved a measure of success, enabling him to support his retired parents.

* **Full Bio:** Balken Ribb's journey began when he arrived in Vallencia as a young tadpole, an immigrant alongside his parents and cousin Lina, hailing from one of Minthar's colonial islands. The early days in the sprawling city were fraught with difficulty; Frogkin were not as readily accepted then, and his family endured considerable persecution and hardship.
  
  His formative years were spent in the bustling environment of an inn located in the Lower West Side of Vallencia. His father served as a cook there, renowned for his culinary skills, particularly his perfected Juju fruit pie recipe that became a significant draw for the establishment. His mother worked tirelessly as a maid in the same inn. Growing up in this setting, Balken absorbed the intricacies of the innkeeping trade from his parents. His father, recognizing his son's interest and potential, passed down the cherished Juju fruit pie recipe.
  
  As Balken matured into a young adult, he naturally transitioned into working at the inn alongside his parents. However, adversity struck when his father fell gravely ill. Balken stepped up, taking over his father's demanding duties in the kitchen. The strain soon took its toll on his mother, who, burdened with double shifts to make ends meet, also succumbed to illness.
  
  Faced with the daunting responsibility of supporting both his ailing parents, Balken found his wages as a line cook insufficient. Driven by a mix of desperation and determination, he made a bold decision. He approached the Bank of Vallencia, securing a substantial loan – enough to cover his parents' medical treatments and to fund his own ambitious venture: a new inn.
  
  With this capital, Balken established "The Not So Shabby Cat Inn" in the more respectable Middle Eastern Ring of Vallencia. He introduced his father's Juju fruit pie, which quickly gained popularity among his patrons. However, in a city teeming with inns, a good pie alone wasn't enough to guarantee success. Balken, keenly aware of this, innovated. He began to host nightly entertainment – a diverse array of acts, from theatrical performances to musicians, and on occasion, when no act was lined up, he would even put on a show himself. This was a masterstroke, as it provided the middle-class citizens of Vallencia with access to affordable entertainment, a luxury previously confined to the affluent Upper Ring.
  
  Over the ensuing years, Balken's hard work and ingenuity paid off. "The Not So Shabby Cat Inn" carved out a niche for itself, becoming a well-known and cherished establishment among the city's middle-class populace. His success has allowed him to provide a comfortable retirement for his parents, whom he has moved into their own one-bedroom apartment in the Middle Ring. He remains a devoted son, checking in on them regularly every weekend or two.
  
  More recently, a few months ago, Balken hired the entertainer Dobbin and his crew to provide the nightly shows, continuing the tradition that helped build his inn's reputation. His cousin, Lina, who had accompanied them to Vallencia, went her own way some time ago, and Balken has not seen her in a while, unaware of her current clandestine activities as a scout for the Iron Veil.
