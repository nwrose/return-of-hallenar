He was known for his striking, striped red-and-white clothing and a generally pompous, somewhat irresponsible attitude. Before his death, he was forcibly transformed into a grotesque, hulking figure.
**Alignment:** (Likely Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral, driven by a mix of duty, insecurity, and a desire to prove himself. His final actions were coerced by [Seraphim Vos](npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/seraphim-vos/seraphim-vos.md), though he attempted to warn the players.)
**Occupation/Role:** Formerly: Nobleman of the [Expendable Family](factions/minthar-factions/expendable-family/expendable-family.md), [Keeper of Hallenar's Journal](factions/minthar-factions/council-of-mages/keeper-of-hallenars-journal.md), Emissary of the Council of Mages.

Later, a tragic antagonist forced to fight the players. In his final moments, he attempted to warn them about Seraphim Vos, potentially shifting their perception of him.

## Detailed Appearance

### Original Appearance:

* **Race:** Human
* **Build & Height:** Small to moderate height, somewhat wide or stout in stature.
* **Hair & Eyes:** Ginger hair. Green eyes.
* **Distinguishing Features (Original):** A prominent (possibly dyed) blonde handlebar mustache and beard. Known for his pompous demeanor and a reputation for irresponsibility.
* **Typical Attire (Original):** Fine, strikingly patterned clothing, notably including red and white stripes. Befitting an aristocrat from the capital with a flamboyant and somewhat pompous taste.

### Transformed Appearance (before death):

* **Build & Height:** Grew to approximately three times his original size, with a hulking, non-athletic frame composed of grotesque, rapidly expanded tumorous muscle masses.
* **Skin & Eyes:** Body pigment turned a sickly green. and eyes bloodshot red.
* **Distinguishing Features (Transformed):** His original face remained vaguely recognizable despite the transformation. His clothes were ripped and tattered due to his sudden growth.
* **Overall Impression (Transformed):** A monstrous and pitiable figure, clearly a victim of horrific experimentation.

## Personality & Demeanor

* **Original Demeanor:** Outwardly carried himself with a **pompous attitude**, but this likely masked underlying insecurities. He never fully bought into the traditional, staid role his family expected. He had a reputation for being somewhat irresponsible and untrustworthy. He was keen on sword fighting in his youth (a passion his father, [Sir Expendable Sr](npcs/minthar-npcs/sir-expendable-sr/sir-expendable-sr.md), made him give up, deeming it unsuitable for an aristocrat who should rely on wit) and prided himself on outwitting opponents. Despite his family's expectations, he was more of a "when they're responsible, they're responsible" kind of individual, implying inconsistency.
* **Transformed Demeanor (before death):** Likely driven by immense pain, confusion, and Seraphim Vos's mental commands. His final words indicate a return of his own will and a desire to warn others.
* **Speech Patterns/Voice (Original):** Educated and formal, likely tinged with his pompous attitude. (Transformed voice likely deep and distorted).
* **Ideals (Original):** Upholding family honor (more out of obligation than deep conviction initially), serving the Council of Mages (as a means to prove himself), seeing justice done for his [father's murder](npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/ignis-luvten/ignis-letter-to-kaili/ignis-letter-to-kaili.md). A strong underlying desire to prove his detractors wrong.
* **Bonds (Original):** The legacy of his great-grandfather (and the pressure it entailed), [Hallenar's Sealing Journal](items/key-items/hallenars-sealing-journal.md) (as a symbol of his new responsibility), his duty to the Council of Mages, the memory of his murdered father, Sir Expendable Sr.
* **Flaws (Original):** His pomposity could make him underestimate others. His reputation for irresponsibility was largely earned. He was insecure about his capabilities and whether he truly deserved his inherited position, leading to a strong desire to prove himself. His choice of companions in the capital was questionable.

## Motivations & Goals

### Original Motivations in Vallencia:

1. Consult with [Kathilda Stallia](npcs/vallencia-npcs/vallencia-core-npcs/kathilda-stallia/kathilda-stallia.md) (Chariel's mother, head of the [Stallia Shipping Company](factions/vallencia-factions/stallia-shipping-company/stallia-shipping-company.md)) regarding the Centennial Offering.
1. Retrieve the [Key to Hallenar's Sealing Journal](items/key-items/key-to-hallenars-sealing-journal.md) from [Dracus Sinthar](npcs/vallencia-npcs/vallencia-parliament-npcs/dracus-sinthar/dracus-sinthar.md) (King's advisor, leader of the Parliament) at the [Vallencia Parliament Treasury](places/kingdom-of-minthar/vallencia/vallencia-parliament-treasury/vallencia-parliament-treasury.md).
1. Seek justice for his father's (Sir Expendable Sr.'s) murder by [Ignis Luvten](npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/ignis-luvten/ignis-luvten.md).
1. **Prove himself capable and responsible** in his new role as Keeper of Hallenar's Journal, defying rumors of nepotism and his past irresponsibility.

* **Coerced Motivation (before death):** Under Seraphim Vos's mental influence, his goal was to attack the players ("Beat them. This is your chance to get your revenge.")
* **Final Motivation:** To warn the players about Seraphim Vos and her experiments.

## Background & History

* Sir Expendable was a human aristocrat from a wealthy and high-ranking noble family in the capital. His father, **Sir Expendable Sr.**, was murdered by Ignis Luvten.
* In his youth, he was very interested in sword fighting, but his father, **Sir Expendable Sr.**, forced him to give it up, insisting that as an aristocrat, he should rely on outwitting opponents rather than martial skill.
* He never fully embraced the traditional, serious role expected by his family, leading to a reputation for being somewhat irresponsible and untrustworthy.
* He inherited the duty of Keeper of Hallenar's Journal from his late great-grandfather. There were rumors that he only received this significant position due to nepotism and that he was too irresponsible for such a vital task. This fueled a strong desire in him to prove these perceptions wrong.
* The Council of Mages dispatched him to Vallencia with several critical tasks, primarily to consult with **Kathilda Stallia** and retrieve the key to Hallenar's Journal from **Dracus Sinthar**.
* His family has long been involved in duties related to ancient powers and pacts, including the Centennial Offering to the Beast of Vallencia.

### Arrival in Vallencia and First Encounters:

* Upon arriving in Vallencia, Sir Expendable joined a tour group led by **Elise**, which included Brad Romance and **Shirley Topplepots**. He was carrying 100 gold pieces at the time, which were presumably taken from him after the assault.
* The tour led them to [The Not So Shabby Cat Inn](places/kingdom-of-minthar/vallencia/the-not-so-shabby-cat-inn/the-not-so-shabby-cat-inn.md) to watch a play by Dobbin Cobblepot III, where Sir Expendable was invited to participate.
* During the play, a "rumbling" occurred. Afterwards, Dobbin and Brad lured him into an alley and knocked him unconscious.

### Capture, Transformation, and Death:

* After being knocked out, Sir Expendable awoke imprisoned in a tube filled with mysterious green fluid in an unknown laboratory.
* Over several days, he was repeatedly injected with a substance from [Green Juju Fruit](items/key-items/green-juju-fruit.md), leading to a horrifying and painful transformation.
* While in this state, he heard the voice of **Seraphim Vos** in his head, coercing him to attack the players.
* He was then magically teleported to the Centennial Sealing Festival and forced to fight the players. [Session 6ðŸŽ¡](session-notes/session-6.md)
* During the battle, he was crushed by a falling Ferris wheel. In his final moments, he warned the players about **Seraphim Vos** before she remotely detonated an explosive device in his heart, killing him. [Session 7ðŸ¦·](session-notes/session-7.md)

## Relationships & Connections

**Allies & Friends (Original):**

* He didn't have many true allies or close friends before arriving in [Vallencia](places/kingdom-of-minthar/vallencia/vallencia.md).
