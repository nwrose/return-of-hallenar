## Motivations

**Control the Black Market** – Ensure the Iron Veil’s dominance over Vallencia’s illicit trade.

* **Perfect the [Juju Fruit Experiments](/plotlines/revival-of-hallenar/juju-fruit-experiments)** – Oversee the Iron Veil’s alchemical research, ensuring results at any cost.
* **Strengthen the Iron Veil’s Power** – Remove inefficiencies, whether they be people or ideas.
* **Further the Cult’s Agenda** – Maintain the delicate balance between her work with the Iron Veil and her deeper allegiance to the Cult of Hallenar.

## Background

Born to a wealthy Vallencian merchant and an elven scholar, Seraphim was raised with a deep appreciation for knowledge, power, and control. However, when her father’s business collapsed due to political maneuvering, she learned a valuable lesson—power does not belong to those who deserve it, but to those who take it.

She joined the Iron Veil as a financial and alchemical strategist, quickly rising in rank due to her intellect, efficiency, and utter lack of sentimentality. However, unbeknownst to her Iron Veil colleagues, she is also a devoted member of the Cult of Hallenar to manipulate Vallence for their true goal—the resurrection of Hallenar.

Her role in the Juju Fruit Experiments is one of careful oversight—the potions maker she has commissioned is unaware of her deeper ties, but Seraphim ensures the research remains useful for the Iron Veil and for the Cult.

## Personality

**Ruthlessly Efficient** – Seraphim values results over everything. A failed experiment is wasted time and resources, nothing more.

* **Cold & Calculating** – She does not act out of malice or cruelty, but rather pure logic.
* **Patient & Strategic** – She rarely acts impulsively, preferring to manipulate events from the shadows.
* **Disdainful of Ignorance** – She has no tolerance for incompetence and no patience for fools.
