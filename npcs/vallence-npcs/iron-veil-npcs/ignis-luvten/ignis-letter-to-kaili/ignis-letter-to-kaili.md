My Dearest Kaili,

If you are reading this, then fate has stolen the chance for me to tell you myself. There is much you will hear soon—whispers, lies, twisted truths—but before the world decides the story, I need you to hear mine.

Tonight, I made a mistake. Not in action, but in judgment. I was patrolling the streets of Minthar, as I always do, when I heard a woman cry out. A nobleman, drunk and arrogant, had cornered her in the alley. I did what any knight should do—I stepped in, I put myself between them, and I told him to stop.

He did not.

He lunged with a blade, and I reacted. Instinct, training, survival—I did what I was taught to do. And now he is dead.

I will not lie to you, Kaili—I do not regret saving that woman. I do not regret defending myself. But Minthar does not care for justice when it stands against power. They will not see a knight protecting his people; they will see a commoner who dared to strike down a noble. And for that, they will demand my life.

I ran home, hoping our father would know what to do. He told me he would handle it, and I believed him. But now I realize the truth—he was never trying to save me. He was trying to save himself. To save you.

By the time you read this, I will be gone. Exiled. I do not know where I will go, but I do know this—I will not return. Minthar has no place for me anymore.

But you, Kaili… you still have a future here. You are meant for something greater than this kingdom’s corruption. Do not let them twist you into something you are not. You are strong—not because of your title, but because of who you are.

I was supposed to protect you. I am sorry that this is the only way I can do that now.

Your Brother,
Ignis

(Written days later, in different ink.)

I never sent this letter.

I rode through the rain that night to bring it to you, only to be met by our father before I reached the gates. He told me the truth I already knew—Minthar does not belong to people like me. But he did not turn me in for justice. He turned me in for you.

And for that, I do not know if I hate him or understand him.

I have spent my life fighting to prove my worth, but in the end, I was always a liability. A stain on your legacy. A name that, if whispered too loudly, would drag you down with me.

I do not agree with what he did. But I understand it.

Maybe one day, I will see you again. Maybe one day, I will tell you this in person. But that day will not be today. And I cannot say whether I am grateful or bitter for that.

For now, I will become something else. Something stronger. Something no one can take power from again.

But no matter what I become, I will not forget you.

Your Brother,
Ignis
