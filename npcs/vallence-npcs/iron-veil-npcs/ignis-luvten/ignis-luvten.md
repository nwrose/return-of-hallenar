## Motivations

**Public Motivation:** As a high-ranking Iron Veil enforcer, Ignis is driven by duty, order, and discipline. He believes in strength through control, ensuring that the Iron Veil’s influence remains absolute. He enforces the organization’s will without hesitation, crushing threats to its power and maintaining order in Vallence.

**Private Motivation:** Beneath his stoic and disciplined exterior, Ignis’s true motivation is proving his own worth. Betrayed by his father and exiled from his homeland, he has dedicated his life to mastering the blade, believing that power is the only thing that cannot be stolen. His work for the Iron Veil is a means to an end—he follows orders, but he does not serve blindly. If the Iron Veil ever fails to align with his personal code, he would not hesitate to carve his own path forward.

## Background

**Public Background**: Ignis Luvten was once a knight-commander from a distant land, a highly disciplined warrior who trained in both steel and magic. However, his past is steeped in mystery, and whispers of disgrace and exile surround his name. After leaving his homeland, he found purpose within the Iron Veil, where his unwavering discipline and brutal efficiency made him one of the faction’s most feared enforcers.

**Private Background:** In truth, Ignis was a knight-commander of [Minthar](/places/kingdom-of-minthar/minthar/minthar)— though he was born in the slums, the son of commoners. His mother died during childbirth and his father later fell in love with a noblewoman. They had a daughter, Kaili (Ignis’ half sister). However, it was decided that the noblewoman would marry the [NPCs/Minthar NPCs/King of Minthar/King of Minthar](../../../Minthar%20NPCs/King%20of%20Minthar/King%20of%20Minthar.md). To protect his sister, Ignis served as Kaili’s royal guard.

One day on patrol in the slums, Ignis witnessed a man taking advantage of a defenseless woman. When confronted, the man attacked Ignis with a knife, to which Ignis instinctually reacted, killing the man. It turns out that the man was a high ranking noble in the king’s court, and the hunt for his killer was soon underway.

Noticing that his home was not far from the crime scene, Ignis dashed home to his father pleading for his advice. His father listened and said “he would take care of it,” and left the house. Ignis’ father had not come home that evening. Feeling the need to tell Kaili what happened, Ignis wrote her a letter that he would deliver that night before she heard a corrupted story from anyone else. As he rode up to the castle in the dark night rain, his father intercepted him. His father told him that he could not risk Kaili’s future as the crowned princess to be jeopardized by Ignis’ mistake. Ignis’ father, desperate to elevate his status as the father of the future queen, had turned Ignis into the police. Ignis had to leave the Minthar capital that night, never seeing Kaili again or delivering his letter. Betrayed and cast out, Ignis hardened himself, swearing that no one would ever have power over him again. Over the years, he honed his flame-wreathed swordplay and spiritual magic, becoming a warrior feared across the battlefield. Ignis added to his letter later that week once he arrived in Vallencia about his encounter with his father and his begrudging agreement with the sentiment of wanting to protect Kaili’s future. He wrote the addition in a different colored ink.

## Personality

Ignis is a man of few words, preferring action over conversation. He speaks calmly, directly, and without hesitation, never wasting words or effort. His emotionless demeanor and cold, unwavering gaze give him the presence of a living weapon—one without doubt, without hesitation, and without fear.

Despite his brutal efficiency, Ignis is not a mindless killer. He follows his own rigid sense of honor, respecting strength, loyalty, and discipline while despising cowardice and deception. However, he does not forgive betrayal, and once trust is lost, it is gone forever.

He rarely lets his emotions show, but deep beneath his hardened exterior, a part of him still wonders what could have been—what kind of life he might have lived had his father chosen him instead of betraying him.
