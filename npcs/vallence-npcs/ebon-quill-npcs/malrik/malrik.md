## Motivations

Malrik craves absolute control over the Ebon Quill, ensuring his syndicate remains untouchable while Vallencia’s factions tear each other apart. He manipulates the Iron Veil and Crimson Shroud, playing them against each other to weaken their influence. Above all, he values freedom—his own above all else—refusing to bow to kings, cults, or gods. Vallencia is just the beginning; his ambitions stretch far beyond, aiming to expand his empire while keeping his true motives hidden behind a smirk and a well-played hand.

## Background

Once a street-level trickster with nothing but his wit and a stolen blade, Malrik clawed his way to the top of Vallence through deception, strategy, and calculated ruthlessness. He founded the Ebon Quill not just as a gang, but as an empire of secrets, turning enemies into assets and rivals into pawns. Somewhere along the way, he became a lycanthrope, embracing the curse as a tool of survival. Now, with power firmly in his grasp, he moves unseen, orchestrating chaos while ensuring that no one—not the Iron Veil, the Crimson Shroud, or the Crown—can ever control him.

## Personality

Malrik is charming, cunning, and utterly unpredictable. He wears a joking smirk and a theatrical flair, but beneath the charisma lies a calculating mind always thinking ten steps ahead. He thrives on control—manipulating enemies, bending allies to his will, and ensuring he always has the upper hand. Despite his silver tongue, he is ruthless when necessary, never hesitating to remove threats with a well-placed word or a deadly strike. He values freedom above all else, refusing to be anyone’s pawn, and sees the world as a grand game of deception and power—one he fully intends to win.
