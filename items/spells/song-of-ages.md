This unique song, an ancient and evolving melody penned by a [Legendary Bard Hero](npcs/vallencia-npcs/vallencias-legendary-heroes/legendary-bard-hero.md) of yore and now acquired by [Dobbin](players/dobbin-cobblepot-iii/dobbin-cobblepot-iii.md), is known collectively as **The Song of Ages**. Its power and resonance grow as the caster imbues it with more energy.

### 2nd Level: Echo of Courage

Your song carries the faint echo of something older, something brave. The air tightens around your allies as they feel a warmth rise in their chests — courage not entirely their own. Their shadows stretch just a bit longer, and if one listens closely, footsteps of past warriors march behind them.

You play this resonant melody echoing with the strength of heroes past. Choose up to **2 creatures** within range that can hear you. For the duration, once per round, those creatures may add **1d4** to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make. Each time the bonus is used, ghostly echoes of past champions briefly shimmer behind the affected creature.

### At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the song's power and name evolve:

**3rd Level: Chorus of Resolve**

* Your voice crescendos with clarity, and the battlefield stirs. Ancient spirits stir beneath your feet. Steel rings sharper, breath flows easier — and behind every step is a silent legion whose victories now lend strength to your own.
* **Targets:** Up to 3 creatures.
* **Bonus Die:** 1d6.
* **Extra Effect:** Once per turn, an affected creature may move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

**4th Level: Anthem of the Ages**

* Your song harmonizes with the pulse of time. For a heartbeat, the world remembers the trials of the ancients — swords once raised, sacrifices once made. A chorus swells behind you, not of voice, but of purpose, threading your allies into the fabric of history itself.
* **Targets:** Up to 4 creatures.
* **Bonus Die:** 1d6.
* **Extra Effect:** Each affected creature may reroll one failed saving throw during the spell’s duration (they must use the new roll).

**5th Level: Ballad of Unbroken Lineage**

* The melody now weaves names long-forgotten into the battlefield. Your allies move with the assurance of those who came before. Ancestral echoes flicker like flame across their blades and eyes, and enemies feel the weight of bloodlines not yet extinguished.
* **Targets:** Up to 5 creatures.
* **Bonus Die:** 1d8.
* **Extra Effect:** The first damage roll made by each affected creature during the spell's duration gains a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.

**6th Level: War-Song of the Endless Chain**

* The melody no longer belongs to you. It is sung through you. The wind howls with it. The stones resonate. In that moment, your companions are not just warriors — they are heirs to a war that never ended, vessels for a promise made in ages past. To fight is to honor those that never had the chance.
* **Targets:** Up to 6 creatures.
* **Bonus Die:** 1d8.
* **Extra Effect:** Each affected creature may, once during the spell's duration, choose to deal maximum damage on a single weapon attack or spell damage roll.

**7th Level: Echo of Legends**

* This is not a song — it is a reckoning. With every note, history breathes. The banners of fallen nations unfurl in the air; phantoms of ancient heroes flash like lightning; even time seems to hesitate. Your allies are no longer merely present — they are remembered. In this moment, they stand with every soul who dared to defy fate.
* **Targets:** Up to 6 creatures.
* **Bonus Die:** 1d10.
* **Extra Effects:**
  * Enemies within 10 feet of any affected ally have disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against any spell or effect originating from that ally.
  * Each affected creature may, once during the spell's duration, choose to roll one d20 test (ability check, attack roll, or saving throw) with advantage.
