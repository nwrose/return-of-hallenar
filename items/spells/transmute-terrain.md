This powerful spell, a marvel of practical transmutation, was originally developed by the [Legendary Wizard Hero](/npcs/vallencia-npcs/vallencias-legendary-heroes/legendary-wizard-hero). Its most renowned use was during the historic [Kraken Battle](/session-notes/session-9), where it was instrumental in constructing [Vallence's Central Pillar](/places/kingdom-of-minthar/vallence/vallence-central-pillar/vallence-central-pillar), a testament to its potent earth-shaping capabilities. The knowledge of this spell has since been passed to [Crooked Eye](/players/crooked-eye/crooked-eye)\].

You manipulate a small portion of the terrain within range, subtly reshaping it to suit your needs. Choose a **10-foot cube** of natural terrain (stone, dirt, mud, sand, water, or vegetation) within range. You may transform the terrain within the area in one of the following ways:

* **Solid ground to loose earth or mud:** This area becomes difficult terrain.
* **Water to slippery ice, or ice to water:** If turned to ice, the area is difficult terrain.
* **Stone to cracked, unstable rubble:** This area becomes difficult terrain.
* **Thorny underbrush to open ground, or vice versa:** If turned to thorny underbrush, the area is difficult terrain and creatures moving through it take 1d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet they travel.
* **Sand to glassy terrain:** This area becomes difficult terrain and reflects bright light, potentially dazzling creatures looking at it.

Creatures standing on or moving through the affected area when it is transformed must succeed on a **DC 14 Dexterity saving throw** or fall prone. If the terrain becomes hazardous in a way that could directly cause injury (e.g., jagged stone erupting, sharp ice forming, or becoming thorny underbrush), creatures who fail their saving throw also take **1d6 damage** of an appropriate type (piercing, slashing, or cold).

This change is temporary and the terrain returns to its natural state at the end of the spell's duration unless the spell is cast at a higher level.

### At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell's capabilities increase:

* **3rd Level:** The affected area increases to a **20-foot cube**.
* **4th Level:** The affected area increases to a **30-foot cube**.
* **5th Level:** The affected area increases to a **40-foot cube**.
* **6th Level:** The affected area increases to a **60-foot cube**.
* **7th Level:** You may target **two non-adjacent 60-foot cube areas** with a single casting.
* **8th Level:** The terrain transformation becomes **permanent** and does not revert at the end of the duration. Concentration is still required for the initial 1 minute to establish the change.
* **9th Level:** The transformation is **instantaneous** (no concentration required), affects a **100-foot cube**, and will override any non-magical terrain and any magical terrain created by a spell of 8th level or lower.
