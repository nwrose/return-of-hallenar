# Description

This ancient, sun-shaped amulet has a glowing orange gemstone at its center that pulses like a flickering flame. Said to have once belonged to the Barbarian Hero who fought beside the great champions of Vallencia 2,000 years ago, the Amulet of Solario is more than a symbol of valor—it is a beacon of inner fire, a connection to an ancient and enduring spirit of resistance.

Legends speak of a tribe devoted to the sun and flame, protectors of the land who believed in strength through passion, warmth, and explosive fury.

### Tier 1: Ember's Blessing

* **Passive:** You have resistance to fire damage.
* **Active (1/day):** As a bonus action, you can activate the amulet to cause your body to radiate heat. For 1 minute, any creature that hits you with a melee attack takes fire damage equal to your Constitution modifier.

*Notes: This amulet can only be attuned to by a Barbarian who has a connection to the flames of Solario—either by ancestry, fate, or the recognition of the ancient spirit who guards its legacy.*
