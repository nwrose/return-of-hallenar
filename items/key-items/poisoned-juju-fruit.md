# Poisoned Juju Fruit

**Tags:** #KeyItem #Ingredient #NaturalResource #Poison #CultActivity #PlotDevice #AlchemicalByproduct
**Item Type:** Fruit (Poisoned Variant)
**Rarity:** Rare (current known version), potentially Very Rare or Legendary for more potent variants.
**Magical Properties:** Highly Poisonous, causes confusion, has an unusual pacifying/domesticating effect on Worgs (specifically Sir).
**Attunement Required:** No

## I. General Description

* **Appearance:** While sharing the same shape as a normal [Juju Fruit](/Juju%20Fruit), its coloration is a stark and vibrant purpley-green, a clear visual distinction from the reddish-orange of its benign counterpart. The fruit itself bears no specific marks or symbols.
* **Sensory Details:**
  * **Smell:** Emits an overwhelmingly vile and offensive odor, akin to rotting flesh. The smell is so potent that it can cause crowds to disperse and makes anyone reluctant to be near it.
  * **Feel:** The skin is unnaturally smooth, almost glassy to the touch, yet the fruit remains squishy, similar in texture to a pepper.
* **Distinguishing Features:** Its ghastly purple-green color and unbearable stench make it easily identifiable and distinct from a regular Juju Fruit.

## II. Origin & Lore

* **Typical Source/Location:** First discovered by [Dobbin](/players/dobbin-cobblepot-iii/dobbin-cobblepot-iii) and [Chariel](/players/chariel-von-dutch/chariel-von-dutch) in crates (marked with [Cult Symbol](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/cult-symbol)) within the [Stallia Shipping Company Warehouse](/places/kingdom-of-minthar/vallencia/stallia-shipping-company-warehouse/stallia-shipping-company-warehouse). It is now believed that these fruits are a byproduct of alchemical experiments conducted by [Seraphim](/npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/seraphim-vos/seraphim-vos) and the [NPCs/Vallence NPCs/Vallence Core NPCs/Potions Lady/Potions Lady](/npcs/vallence-npcs/vallence-core-npcs/potions-lady/potions-lady) in their attempt to create an immortality serum. [The Cult](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/the-cult-of-hallenar) appears to be responsible for weaponizing or distributing this byproduct.
* **Method of Acquisition:** Players (Dobbin and Chariel) found them in shipping crates. The cult presumably acquires them from the source of the experiments or has a hand in their creation/alteration.
* **Cultural/Historical Significance:** Its existence points to a sinister plot involving a cult, the misuse of powerful alchemical experiments, and a potential threat to [Vallencia](/places/kingdom-of-minthar/vallencia/vallencia) or beyond. The fact that more potent variants are assumed to exist is deeply concerning.

## III. Properties & Uses

* **Primary Use(s):** Intended as a potent poison, capable of incapacitating or killing individuals and potentially angering or harming large beasts.
* **Secondary Use(s):**
  * Has been used by Dobbin to domesticate his pet worg, [Sir](/players/dobbin-cobblepot-iii/sir/sir).
  * Could be a component in even more dangerous alchemical concoctions.
* **Known Effects (Poison - Ingestion):**
  * **Target(s):** Any creature that ingests it. Observed to be effective against large beasts.
  * **Delivery Method:** Ingestion.
  * **Saving Throw:** DC 15 Constitution saving throw.
  * **On a Failed Save:** The creature takes 4d8 poison damage, is **Poisoned** for 1 hour, and is **Confused** for 1 hour. Additionally, the creature continues to take 4d8 poison damage at the start of each of its turns for the duration of 1 hour, or until an antidote is administered.
  * **On a Successful Save:** The creature takes half as much initial poison damage (2d8) and is not subjected to the recurring damage or the Poisoned and Confused conditions.
  * **Manifestation:** Effects are immediate upon consumption.
  * **Duration:** The Poisoned and Confused conditions, as well as the recurring damage, last for 1 hour unless an antidote is administered.
  * **Antidote/Cure:** An antidote is believed to exist, but its composition is currently unknown.
* **Known Effects (Other):**
  * **On Sir the Worg (Dobbin's pet):** Sir not only shows a fondness for the Poisoned Juju Fruit but also seems to suffer no ill effects from consuming it. If anything, he appears happier and more content. Dobbin successfully used these fruits to help domesticate Sir. He will actively paw at Dobbin's leg for more.
* **Ingredient For / Component Of:** The extracted poison could be used in other nefarious ways.

## IV. Notable Examples or Known Keepers

* **The crates found by Dobbin and Chariel:** The first known discovery of this variant.
* **The Cult:** The apparent creators (or at least distributors) of this weaponized version.
* **Seraphim & The Potion Lady:** The original source of the experimental process that likely creates the base substance.
