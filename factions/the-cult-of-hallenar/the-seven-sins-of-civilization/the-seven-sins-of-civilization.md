# The Seven Sins of Civilization

\#SevenSinsOfCivilization
*“Man believes himself the master of the world, but he is only the herald of its ruin.”*

The Seven Sins of Civilization are not mere ideas—they are tangible forces, formed at the moment of [Hallenar](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/hallenar)’s sealing. They are the greatest failings of mankind, given shape and purpose.

Each Sin represents a fundamental flaw of civilization, one that feeds upon itself and perpetuates destruction. As long as civilization continues to spread, so too do these sins.

These sins are neither mortal nor divine—they are concepts given flesh, born of [Hallenar](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/hallenar)’s shattered soul.

**The Seven Sins of Civilization are:**

1. [Gluttony](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/the-seven-sins-of-civilization/gluttony) – The Overconsumption of Nature
1. [Destruction](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/the-seven-sins-of-civilization/destruction) – The Devastation of Natural Land
1. [Order](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/the-seven-sins-of-civilization/order) – The Lie of Civilization’s Stability
1. [Hubris](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/the-seven-sins-of-civilization/hubris) – The Illusion of Human Supremacy
1. [Ignorance & Indifference](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/the-seven-sins-of-civilization/ignorance-and-indifference) – The Blind and the Uncaring
1. [Mortality](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/the-seven-sins-of-civilization/mortality) – The Human Fear of Death
