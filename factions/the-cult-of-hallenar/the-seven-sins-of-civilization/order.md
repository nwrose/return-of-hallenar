**The Lie of Civilization’s Stability**

## Meaning

Civilization’s "order" is a myth. Governments, laws, and hierarchies are human constructs, unnatural and doomed to fail.

## Philosophy

*"You build walls and laws, thinking they protect you. But order is the greatest lie of all. True nature is chaos, and it cannot be tamed."*
Intelligent creatures believe that order is made for the benefit of the society. Governments are supposed to protect them and ensure them paths to happiness. In reality Order suffocates. Order will go in for a deep embrace and make you feel safe, make you feel cared for, at home. Then, you'll ask for some space, and you're ready to try making your own life, your own decisions. But now Order needs you. Order, in order to exist, needs those whom will fall in order. It will keep hugging. squeezing. tighter and tighter. Crushing. There are those that are more flexible than others. Harder to crush under Order's tight embrace. But can they save those less abled. Less privileged. Less free. Or would they even want to.

## Symbol

A crumbling tower, its stones scattered like dead leaves.
