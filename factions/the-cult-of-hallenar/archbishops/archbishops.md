# Archbishops

**What is an Archbishop?**

* An Archbishop is the highest-ranking [Cultist](factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/cultists.md) of a specific Sin.
* They are the mortal extension of their [Abyssborn](factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/abyssborns/abyssborns.md), wielding its power.

Each bears a physical mark ([Sin Tattoo](factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/archbishop-marks/archbishop-marks.md)) and an [Abyssborn Bond](factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/abyssborn-bonds/abyssborn-bonds.md) (a relic connected to their Sin).

Destroying an Archbishop does not destroy the [sin](factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/the-seven-sins-of-civilization/the-seven-sins-of-civilization.md). A new one will always rise.
