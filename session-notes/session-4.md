## Summary or key decisions

* Dobbin and Chariel gathered intel on the Vallence gang structure before heading to The Shabby Cat with Selene. There, they hired two prostitutes, Penny and Shartrice, to trick an orc and a gnome into leaving their boots outside, allowing Dobbin and Chariel to sneak into The Hollow Pulse disguised as gang members. Selene stayed behind to protect the women.
* Inside the nightclub, Dobbin chatted with Cass and Lina, learning that the Iron Veil has an upcoming trade deal with Crystal Forge. The deal involves Crystal Forge supplying amber in exchange for Iron Veil mercenaries to protect the mines from enemy incursions. They also discovered that Crystal Forge has begun oppressing deep gnomes, treating them as second-class citizens under the corrupt rule of the Crystal Forge King’s Advisor.
* Dobbin also learned that Lina wants to escape the Iron Veil but needs leverage on Ignis. Meanwhile, Chariel was gambling with Jex, using charm magic to learn that the guild is conducting dangerous experiments with a local potions maker to develop a potent healing elixir. However, the formula is incomplete, and the missing ingredient is unknown. The experiments are being tested on people in Vallence, including guild members.
* Dobbin and Chariel decided to steal the nightclub’s gravity-altering orb while also planning a heist to steal critical documents from Seraphim’s office.
* The session ended with an Ebon Quill intern running into the hideout, announcing that Stallia Shipping was up in flames—and that Chariel had been seen leaving the scene.
