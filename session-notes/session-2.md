  * He sees that he has become some half orc
  * He looks inside Brad's bag and finds the cult pin
    * He believes that he's become a cultist

* Chariel and Dobbin decide that Dobbin will go check out the docks to investigate the rumbling that is scheduled for noon there and Chariel will go with Olive to the parliament to see what the city is doing about the rumbling
