## Details

### Raw notes

* Brad wakes up in his body, not remembering the past day (while Chariel was controlling his body)
* Dobbin and Brad visit Malrik at the Ebon Quill Bar and debrief their findings, handing over the documents and the research notebook from Seraphim's office
  * The notebook has research notes of a healing potion in the works that is missing an unknown key ingredient
  * The test subjects initially showed mild symptoms of sickness, progressively worsening with later iterations (sweating, warts, growths)
  * Malrik is wondering where the Iron Veil is getting these subjects
* Malrik is pleased with the information the players provided and offers information about the treasury
  * Guarded by a guardian
  * Only entrances are through the parliament and an access duct at the top of the pillar
  * Ebon quill members that guard the pillar find it difficult to communicate since their communication crystals face significant interference around the pillar
  * A persistent low pitch hum can be heard from the pillar when the streets of Vallence are silent
* Malrik asks the players if they are still in contact with their Iron Veil informants (Lina and Cass), to which the players said they are not
* Malrik offers the players membership to the Ebon Quill "family" with the expectation that they will perform tasks that the Ebon Quill assigns to them in exchange for access to the Ebon Quill's resource and information network and benefits
  * The players accept
  * Brad in private tells Dobbin that he already has his clan and that he can't be joining another family-like group
  * Dobbin makes the point that Brad has already abandoned his clan
* Dobbin asks Malrik if the Ebon Quill has a doctor
  * Malrik tells Dobbin about Lucious who is the guild's doctor, with the description of a old man with large circular glasses and a balding head with tufts of gray hair on the sides
  * He mentions that Lucious along with other Ebon Quill members were currently at the Centennial Sealing Festival in the Town Square
* The players leave Vallence through the drainage grate by the Town Square Fountain
  * They exit right behind the merchant booth of the Wizard Crooked Eye (new player character)
* Crooked Eye sells Dobbin 2 Masks of Another which change the appearance of the wearer's face to anyone they can imagine
  * Without a proper image of the face, the mask will choose a random person within the player's direct vicinity that fits the concept generally
* Crooked Eye has seen the doctor Dobbin and Brad are looking for in the crowd of the stage
* The Vallencia playrites guild is performing as an opener for Guzzlethroat the Magnificent
  * Sicily and Thad (Dobbin's acting troupe) are putting on the show
* The players talk to Lucious about Brad's condition
  * He tells them that there are two souls currently inhabiting Brad's body, fighting for control
  * The souls seem to be able to gain control of the body during periods of lapses in mental fortitude, such as sleep
  * Having multiple souls would normally drive a person insane, very quickly killing them, but it seems like Brad's simple mind has prevented this from happening immediately
  * Being inhabited by multiple souls is slowly killing Brad and Chariel though
  * Lucious explains that Chariel's soul was placed into Brad's body by a Magic Jar spell
    * A vessel is required to separate Chariel, otherwise he'll return to Brad's body
* Sicily finds Dobbin in the crowd after the show
