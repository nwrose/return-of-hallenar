## Summary or key decisions

* Chariel informed Culvis about an imposter, using the unique dice as proof. Culvis agreed to help track the fake Chariel and warned about a new, dangerous treasury guardian.
* Dobbin investigated the treasury, found no immediate gold, and spotted a large robot guardian and a glowing purple key. He misrepresented the amount of gold to the others.
* The party reunited with Olive at the library, who shared a different account of the four heroes' sacrifice where their names were erased from history.
* Tim, Brad's childhood friend, was found stalking Chariel, having been sent by the fake Chariel to find the dice using a tracking spell.
* The party learned Tim made a deal with the fake Chariel for the tracking spell to save his adventuring party.
