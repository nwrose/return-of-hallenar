## Summary or key decisions

* Dobbin acquired a potion for a stiff neck from a dockside shop and learned from Timothee at Stallia Shipping that Chariel hadn't shown up for work.
* Chariel and Olive attended a parliament council meeting led by Dracus Sinthar, discussing tremors and the disappearance of Sir Expendable. Kathilda Stallia raised concerns about ship disappearances, leading to Nicholas Sutter's suggestion (readily agreed to by Dracus) to switch to land-based trade routes. Selena, a parliament scribe, found Dracus's quick agreement suspicious.
* The party convinced Timothee to audition for a play, leaving Stallia Shipping in their care.
* A tremor caused giant crabs to attack dock workers; Dobbin and Chariel helped defeat them, using a Molotov cocktail made from stolen expensive alcohol.
* Dobbin discovered crates with cult symbols at the Stallia shipping warehouse, containing discolored, foul-smelling Juju Fruits. He pocketed one and saw a robed figure flee.
* Dobbin and Chariel lost the robed figure in a crowd but learned from children that the figure went down a grate in the town square.
* The poisoned Juju fruit's odor repulsed the crowd. Chariel, traumatized, ran off and encountered a doppelganger (Fake Chariel) making a deal to burn down Stallia Shipping.
* Chariel used his dice to wager against the man coerced by Fake Chariel, rolling a 19. The dice dispelled the magical compulsion on the man and destroyed the money from Fake Chariel.
* Dobbin and Chariel entered the grate into a different area of Vallence, where they were stopped by Malrik, who initially threatened them over Olive but then offered information on the central pillar treasury in exchange for help.
