## Summary or key decisions

* Player characters aligned their motivations:
  * Dobbin seeks to save Crystal Forge and Vallencia for the future of the arts.
  * Chariel wants to save his home.
  * Crooked Eye aims to destroy the cult and confront his father.
* The group enters Parliament, convincing the guards to allow them into the Vallencia Treasury with a miraculous persuasion check.
* Inside, they find a painting showing Vallencia’s heroes fighting a terrible beast—but the image of the beast is burned away.
* Dobbin jumps into the painting (followed by Crooked Eye and Chariel), transporting them into a memory of Vallencia 2000 years in the past, during the unleashing of the Kraken.
* The trio avoids fighting the beast and heads to the primitive version of Parliament, now a longhouse.
* They speak to the Frog Elder (part of the Elder Council), pretending to be sent from the capital to learn about Hallenar’s sealing and the soul stone.
* The Frog Elder shows them a chest full of treasures but notes it is missing the key to the notebook.
* Players later rejoin the battle—just in time to see one of the original heroes (the Barbarian) die, an event that “didn’t happen” in recorded history, indicating that the memory has been altered.
* The players show the Wizard hero the notebook and she describes the notebook to be a part of the ritual she designed to seal Hallenar
* The Kraken burrows under the landmass toward the future location of Vallencia’s treasury.
* The remaining heroes ask the players for aid, and the party splits up to assist:
  * Crooked Eye pairs with the Wizard Hero.
  * Dobbin joins the Bard Hero.
  * Chariel partners with the Warlock Hero.
