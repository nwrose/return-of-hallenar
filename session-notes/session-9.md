* Dobbin provided distractions
* Chariel and Crooked Eye dealt with Giant Crabs and Gelatinous cubes that split when killed
* Legendary Bard hero leapt inside the Kraken's mouth and discovered a magically dense core with the same signature as the Hallenar Notebook intertwined with the Kraken's core

* As the cavern began collapsing, the Legendary Wizard hero concentrated on a transmutation spell to construct a pillar that would support the crumbling rock overhead
* Ragnar was interfering with Chariel's magic
* Legendary Warlock hero made a deal with his patron, Ragnar, to gain the power to defeat the beast in exchange for a price his descendent (Chariel) would have to pay
  * Legendary Warlock burned away his skin and flesh to attack the beast
  * Chariel's dice reacted violently to Ragnar's presence
* Crooked Eye separated the Kraken flesh connecting the stone to the Kraken's stomach
* The stone's dense magic let out a powerful burst that downed Crooked Eye and disrupted the Wizard Hero's spell, causing the cavern walls to begin collapsing more
