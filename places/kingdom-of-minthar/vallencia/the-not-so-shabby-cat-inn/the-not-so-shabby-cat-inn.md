## Description

The Not So Shabby Cat Inn is a moderately priced and popular establishment located in the Eastern part of Valencia's Middle Ring. It caters primarily to the city's middle class, offering a comfortable atmosphere and, most notably, affordable nightly entertainment. This distinguishes it from many other inns in Valencia, providing access to shows, music, and performances that might otherwise be exclusive to the wealthier patrons of the Upper Ring.

The inn was founded by Balken Ribb, a Frogkin entrepreneur with a challenging past. Having immigrated to Valencia with his family as a youth and facing initial hardship, Balken learned the inn trade from his parents who worked at another establishment in the Lower West Side. After his parents fell ill, Balken took a significant loan from the Bank of Valencia to establish his own inn. He leveraged his father's famous Juju fruit pie recipe to draw initial customers, but it was his innovative idea to host regular, varied entertainment that truly solidified The Not So Shabby Cat Inn's reputation. While not the most luxurious inn in Valencia, it's a well-regarded and lively spot, known for its unique offerings and the determination of its owner.

## Notable NPCs

* **[Balken Ribb](/npcs/vallencia-npcs/vallencia-core-npcs/balken-ribb/balken-ribb):** (Frogkin, Owner/Proprietor)
  * **Background:** Balken is the heart and soul of The Not So Shabby Cat Inn. He arrived in Valencia as a young tadpole with his parents, who were immigrants from a Mintharan island colony. His family faced persecution, and his early life was marked by hardship. His father was a skilled cook at an inn in the Lower West Side, and his mother worked as a maid there. Balken learned the inn business from them. When his father fell ill, Balken took over cooking duties, using his father's renowned Juju fruit pie recipe. Later, his mother also became ill due to overwork. Determined to provide for them and make his own way, Balken took out a substantial loan to purchase and establish The Not So Shabby Cat Inn in the Middle Ring. He introduced nightly entertainment to set his inn apart, making performances accessible to the common folk. He is a resilient and resourceful individual.
  * **Motivations:** To provide for his (now recovered) parents, to run a successful and respected business, and to offer a welcoming space for middle-class citizens of Valencia.
