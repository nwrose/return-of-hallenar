**Progress at What Cost?**

*‚ÄúThe world was once wild and free. Now, it is shackled by roads, steel, and coin. Can civilization and nature coexist, or is one destined to consume the other?‚Äù*

### **Description**

[The Cult of Hallenar](/factions/the-cult-of-hallenar/the-cult-of-hallenar) believes that civilization has gone too far, stripping nature bare for personal and industrial gain.

* The [Kraken](/npcs/monsters/kraken/kraken) represents an ancient force that has been bound by human intervention, unable to reclaim its place in the cycle.
* [Seraphim](/npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/seraphim-vos/seraphim-vos) manipulates civilization‚Äôs tools‚Äîscience, law, and governance‚Äîto destroy it from within.
* [Crystal Forge](/places/crystal-forge/crystal-forge) is an example of progress running rampant, where its people (deep gnomes) are exploited, and nature is treated as nothing more than a resource.

### üí° **Question for the Players to Consider:**

* Is progress worth it if it comes at the cost of the world itself?
* What is the true balance between nature and civilization?
* Should civilization be torn down or reformed?
