**The Few Controlling the Many**

*“The rich grow richer, the poor grow weaker. The system isn’t broken—it’s working exactly as intended.”*

### Description

* [Crystal Forge](/places/crystal-forge/crystal-forge)’s deep gnome population is being forced into second-class citizenship, with only the wealthy given access to a cure for the plague.
* The [Iron Veil](/factions/vallence-factions/iron-veil/iron-veil) and [Seraphim](/npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/seraphim-vos/seraphim-vos) are hoarding power through alchemy, political control, and trade deals, manipulating nations for their own benefit.
* [The Coliseum](/places/kingdom-of-minthar/the-coliseum/the-coliseum) is a direct representation of a system where people are turned into entertainment for the privileged, suffering for sport.
* The players were framed—not because they’re a threat to Vallencia’s rulers, but because it’s easier to make an example out of them.

### 💡 **Question for the Players to Consider:**

* Should you fight the system head-on or work within it to change it?
* Can oppression ever be overthrown without violence?
* Is it possible to create a society that doesn’t fall into the hands of the powerful?
