**What Happens When You Have Control?**

*“You are only powerless until the day you aren’t. Then what do you do?”*

### Description

* [Seraphim](npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/seraphim-vos/seraphim-vos.md) was once a simple alchemist, but her control over life and death turned her into something monstrous.
* [Ignis](npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/ignis-luvten/ignis-luvten.md) believes only the strong deserve to lead, but in doing so, he has become just like those who cast him aside.
* Even the players are gaining power—but how will they use it? Will they become like those they fight?

### 💡 **Question for the Players to Consider:**

* Does power always corrupt, or does it reveal who someone truly is?
* Can anyone truly wield power selflessly?
* Are the players any different from the enemies they fight?
