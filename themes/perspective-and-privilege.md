**The Blindness to Suffering**

*"They don‚Äôt see the suffering beneath them, because it doesn‚Äôt touch them.‚Äù*

### Description

* [The Coliseum](/places/kingdom-of-minthar/the-coliseum/the-coliseum) is a brutal metaphor‚Äîpeople watch and cheer for blood, never considering the pain of those fighting.

* The wealthy of Vallencia don‚Äôt think twice about the lower districts, the experiments, or the gangs‚Äîthese things exist outside their comfortable world.
* The [Iron Veil](/factions/vallence-factions/iron-veil/iron-veil) is happy to let the poor suffer‚Äî[Seraphim](/npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/seraphim-vos/seraphim-vos) sees them as test subjects and [Ignis](/npcs/vallence-npcs/iron-veil-npcs/ignis-luvten/ignis-luvten) only values the strong.

### üí° \*\*Question for the Players to Consider:

* How do people justify looking the other way?
* Does privilege make someone responsible for helping the less fortunate?
* Are those who suffer doomed to be ignored unless they take power for themselves?
